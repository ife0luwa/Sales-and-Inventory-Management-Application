# Sale and Inventory Manager Application

This Sales/Inventory Management Application is built using Java and Spring Boot. The application provides REST API endpoints to manage products, inventory, and orders.

## Features
The application supports the following features:

- Create a new product
- Update an existing product
- Get a list of all available products
- Place an Order based on availability of product
- Capture basic customer detail (name and phone number) for the Order
- Change the product's price without affecting the total value of orders that have already been placed
- Publish the basic detail of the created Order to Kafka for reporting
